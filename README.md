## Analysing NBA Data

Hello! My name is Filip and I love basketball analytics! I created this repository to gather several `R` scripts that I have been working on and help my look into interesting stuff that occur throughout each NBA season:
* my custom options for tables and charts on `ggplot` and `gt` libraries.
* functions/scripts to scrape players and teams data from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/), [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/stats).
* small projects such as minutes heatmap, continuity chart etc.

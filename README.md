## Analysing NBA Data

Hello! My name is Filip and I love basketball analytics! I created this repository to gather several `R` scripts that I have been working on and help my look into interesting stuff that occur throughout each NBA season:
* my custom options for tables and charts on `ggplot` and `gt` table libraries.
* functions/scripts to scrape players and teams data from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/) and [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
* small projects such as minutes heatmap, continuity chart etc.
